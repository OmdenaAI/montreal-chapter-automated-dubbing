The app should be able to detect speech in the original video and generate a synchronized dubbing in the desired language using advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques. The application will streamline the dubbing process, making it more accessible and cost-effective for various sectors, including education, entertainment, business, tourism, and news."],"metadata":{"id":"RhL8ABK9jnXS"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Problem statement\n","Traditional dubbing methods are time-consuming, expensive, and often require a large team of professionals.

This approach facilitated comprehension, testing, and updates. It also enabled different team members to work on different modules concurrently, thereby enhancing productivity.\n","\n","\n","1.   Video Loading and Audio Extraction Module: Develop a module responsible for loading video files into memory and for extracting the audio track from the video files. Initially, let's assume the videos of interest are hosted on YouTube.\n","2.   Speech Recognition Module: Develop a module that integrates a speech recognition system capable of converting spoken words into text.\n","3.   Translation Module: Build a module responsible for translating the recognized text into another language.\n","4.   Audio Generation (Text-to-Speech) Module: Construct a module that converts the transcribed text into synthesized speech. This module should generate a new audio track in the translated language.\n","5.   Dubbing Module: Design a module responsible for combining the translated text with appropriate audio clips or the output from the Text-to-Speech module. This module should handle synchronization and blending of the audio to create the dubbed version.\n","6.   User Interface Module: Develop a user interface module for the app, enabling users to interact with the different modules. Users should be able to select input files, specify languages, and control the dubbing process.\n","\n","For each module we had a task team charged with its implementation.

We considered several pretrained models, in particular some Hugging Face and PyPi models. We settled on PyPi translate, since this is a multilingual model and we could use one model to translate from one language to another from a large set of languages.\n","\n","The model was easy to implement and worked well. However, we discovered an issue during the whole pipeline testing. The model's API limits the number of calls, so when processing a large text, one might need to wait 24 hours to finish translation.\n","\n","Another issue the team encountered was that sometimes the translated text is longer than the original and does not fit into the designated time stamps. This is a well known problem documented in several papers.
